## Introduction

Brain strokes are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Early prediction and intervention can significantly reduce the adverse effects of strokes. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on various health parameters.

---

## Features

- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive web application for data input and result visualization.
- Real-Time Predictions: Immediate assessment of stroke risk upon data submission.
- Educational Insights: Provides information on factors influencing stroke risk.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/d1i2v3ya/Main_project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Main_project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Methodology

1. Data Collection:

   Utilized a publicly available dataset containing health records related to stroke incidents.

2. Data Preprocessing:

   - Handled missing values.
   - Encoded categorical variables.
   - Normalized numerical features.

3. Model Selection:

   Implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict stroke risk.

4. Model Evaluation:

   Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Web Integration:

   Developed a Flask-based web interface to allow users to input data and receive predictions.

---

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Backend: Python, Flask
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
